# Introduction #

Most of the code was tested once written, but not all tests are completed/well formed/accurated, so if a developer wants to test this code, he/she can use the fpm-test project that comes with the source in the svn.
All the tests are poorly made main classes that do something which runs the code in the simpliest manner we can make.
