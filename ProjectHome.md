**FPM, also known as freax Package Manager or Freackman, is an open source java-based package manager for the Freax GNU/Linux OS.**<br>
Freax is a Unix-like and GNU-based OS which will be available with different kernels running in background, included Linux, BSD, Darwin, React and a hybrid from scratch revolutionary microkernel called, as you intend, Freax.<br>
This project is the fpm project, also known as Freax Package Manager, which will be the package manager of Freax and, as we hope, of other OSes. Our choice of develop in java was mainly the portability of the software in a multiplatform environment in which one can to be not interested in platform-specific features, even in software distribution choice.<br>
We plan to make fpm the most powerful, platform indipendent and fast package management system that you can wish, as well as the only package manager independent of the package.<br><br><br>
